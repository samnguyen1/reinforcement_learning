## ï¿½ CRITICAL: Bibliography Must Be Replaced

The current bibliography at the end of thesis.tex contains placeholder/potentially hallucinated references. **You MUST replace the entire `\begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}` section** with properly formatted entries using the 26 verified references from your literature review PDF:

## What Still Needs Work for "Going for Perfection"

### Chapter 2: Background and Related Work (Needs 3-4x expansion)
**Should include:**
- Formal convergence proofs for tabular RL
- Function approximation theory (LSTD, LSPI, Gradient TD)
- Deep RL methods (DQN, Double DQN, Dueling, Prioritized Replay, Rainbow)
- Complete policy gradient theory (Natural PG, TRPO derivation, PPO)
- SAC and maximum entropy RL framework
- Recent theoretical advances (Neural TD, target networks, global PG convergence, error propagation)
- Related empirical benchmark studies

### Chapter 3: Methodology (Could be more detailed)
- Algorithm pseudocode
- Formal problem statement
- Extended statistical methodology

### Chapter 4: Results (Fill in after A2C/SAC experiments)
- Complete results for all algorithms
- More statistical analysis
- Failure mode analysis

### Chapter 5: Discussion (Needs deeper analysis)
- Connect findings to theoretical predictions
- Detailed practical guidelines
- Troubleshooting guide

### Chapter 6: Conclusion (Adequate but could enhance)
- Summary table of findings
- Recommendations matrix

## Current State

**What you have now:**
-  Publication-quality Abstract (comprehensive, well-cited)
-  Publication-quality Introduction (extensive theoretical context)
- ï¿½ Chapters 2-6: Functional but need expansion
- L Bibliography: Must be completely replaced

**Length:**
- Original: ~515 lines
- Current (with my updates): ~700+ lines
- For true "perfection": ~1500-2000 lines needed

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: I can help you replace the bibliography with exact references from your lit review PDF
2. **SHORT TERM**: Expand Chapter 2 (Background) with theoretical foundations
3. **MEDIUM TERM**: Enhance remaining chapters when experimental data is complete

Would you like me to:
1. Continue expanding Chapter 2 (Background and Related Work) now?
2. Fix the bibliography first with verified references from your PDF?
3. Both?

The thesis is already significantly improved and usable. Further enhancements will make it truly comprehensive and publication-ready!
